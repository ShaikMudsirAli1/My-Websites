          CSS DYNAMIC-FONT SIZING : WHICH ADAPT CHANGES EASILY.


         font-size: rem ---- beauty of the root em ((root em)) is that is does not get affected by upstream
                    size changes and it means and easier to debug
                    so sizing text we must use rem for first priority.
                    instead fo em and percentage



                    1 em ---------- is  16px 

                    40px/16px which is 2.5rem
